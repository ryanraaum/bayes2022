## Setup 

You'll need to install some packages and install the github version of `brms`.

```{r setup-new-packages}
if (packageVersion("brms") == '2.16.3') install.packages("paul-buerkner/brms")
if (!(require("TH.data", quietly = TRUE))) install.packages("TH.data")
if (!(require("projpred", quietly = TRUE))) install.packages("projpred")
```

As always, load up the packages that we need.

```{r setup-packages, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2) # plotting
library(patchwork) # for laying out plots
theme_set(theme_minimal()) # not necessary, I just don't like the default ggplot theme
library(brms) # for Bayesian modeling
library(bayesplot) # for plotting of Bayesian models
library(dplyr) # for data wrangling
library(posterior) # for working with posterior distributions
```
